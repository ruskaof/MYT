# MYT - Manage  Your Time

It is a simple yet useful time(plan) manager that was done using:

 - Jetpack compose
 - Kotlin coroutines & flows
 - Room database
 - Clean architecture (MVVM)
 - Dagger hilt

Current features are:

 - Viewing list of your plans that are sorted by their start-time. Also, plans that are older than today aren't showed in main scedule but they are listed in the archieve.
 - Adding new plan with it's todo date and time with it's name
 - Deleting plans from scedule by long-pressing on them and confirming it in a dialog.
 - Bottom navigation bar  to navigate through screens.
 - Stats screen where you can see  your top-5 plans by your time spent on them in a bar chart and overall stats by time in a pie-chart.

There are lots of things I still want to add and I'm still working on them.
